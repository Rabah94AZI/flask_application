Perfect skin,5,"Wow!  I have always had ‚Äúgood‚Äù skin no acne growing up, and combination skin slightly oily nose and dry everywhere else.  I‚Äôm 44 and have entered the stage where I‚Äôm thinking about Botox, but am terrified of the scared üò≥ look.  This serum is amazing and has really done a lot for my skin.  I use nightly after cleansing and toning, and then apply and let it dry as I find it pills if I apply another serum or retinol/ tret right away.  It is an excellent combination with tret or ret and I apply this after TNS dries.  It is expensive but a little goes a long way and it firms, tones, reduces wrinkles, pores, and gives skin a general glow.  I love it and will continue to purchase.  You will notice improvement right away, and with consistent use it gets better.  ",5/12/23,stephanie,True,1,0

Worth it!,5,"I usually never spend this much on a single product, but this one is worth it. I have combination acne-prone skin that is also pretty sensitive and this has done wonders.

Luxurious Serum to add to routine,4,This is my first time using a growth serum in my skincare routine. I like how moisturizing it is and it layers well with a vitamin C serum.

New Formula Review,4,I use the original formulation of this product for many many years with great success.

Awesome Product,5,"I‚Äôve been using this Serum for several years, beginning with purchasing at my doctor‚Äôs office.  I experienced a notable difference in just a few weeks, which amazed me because my skin was in pretty good shape for my age. Be always used quality products and used SPF.  However, I had just turned 60 at the time and I was starting to see more sagging and wrinkling and signs of age & sun damage.  After a few weeks, things were slightly tighter, denser, more even and overall more healthy looking.  Since then, the aging process of my skin has slowed significantly.

Actually works over time,5,"I feel like this is the only product that actually does anything for anti-aging. Retin A as well. If you use it once a day, your skin will look better, and twice a day will look much more radiant. It takes a few weeks to work. I use less than the suggested full pump and I still get a good result. Sometimes the bottle only dispenses one of the serums, in which case I put it aside in a small container for future use and keep pumping the bottle until both serums come out.",12/25/22,Joanne,True,0,0

But I was looking for some thing that I could use in my daily routine to amp it up a bit. Tried this product thought I liked it then went without it for a couple of months. Definitely noticed! As soon as I started using it in the daily rotation again I immediately started to see results. It just offers a glow that other products have not.

Good for overall tone, texture and skin strength. ",8/28/22,Abby,True,1,0
Simply the best,5,"I wasn't a fan of the old TNS Serum for aesthetic reasons (hated the smell and appearance), but it worked well. But I'm in love with the Advanced formulation! The little scent it has is appealing and the new formulation has a nicer texture. As to how well it works, well, know that this is the only product I've ever put on auto-ship, and that says a lot given the price tag. But it's simply the best serum out there. Every now and then I try another medical-grade serum (Skinbetter and Defenage have been contenders) but I always go back to this one and I get tons of compliments on my 58-year-old skin. FYI, I started using TNS about 10 years ago; not sure I'd recommend it for a young person due to the cost--they might be just as well off with a great moisturizer and sunscreen. But if you can afford it, I'd definitely try it because I don't think there are any better serums out there.",8/26/22,Molly,True,4,0

But this is the perfect example of making a few small tweaks to take something from ""amazing"" to ""can't live without it"". My issue with the last one was it always left a slight orange tint to my skin. And if you accidentally got it in your hairline, it was a mess. This new version goes on clear and it's oh so much better. Well done, SkinMedica!",3/12/22,melissa,False,1,0
Worth every dime!,5,"My plastic surgeon  who does my Botox highly recommended this product.

"Expensive, disappointing",1,"I was really excited to try this serum based on all the reviews I had been reading, but I have to say that so far it has done nothing for my skin; I haven't seen any differences.

Transformative!,5,"This is by far the most expensive product I have ever used. At 35, with sun-damaged skin and many fine lines that are deepening into true wrinkles around the eyes, I decided to give this a try. It is far and a way the most powerful, transformative product I have ever used - and I‚Äôm only 2 weeks in to daily usage. Fine lines appear diminished, pore size is reduced, and my skin is more luminous and moisturized than ever before - with any serum, moisturizer, or combo product I have ever used. Real results were an honest surprise to me, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens after using this for longer.

It‚Äôs not a miracle worker but I‚Äôd say this  serum makes my skin look 4-6 years younger. But then Again, i have been using it daily for about 2 months; it doesn‚Äôt work overnight.  Also, fyi, works well in cuts and gashes for scaring. ",11/10/21,Sharon,True,0,0
An intense serum that works,5,"I tried this serum a few years ago and continue to use it today.  It uniquely dispenses into two separate serums and allows you to blend  and apply to your face.  It is cooling, light and works to smooth wrinkles and lines.  The down side to this product is that it is quite expensive for the amount of serum provided and I question the price and hesitate each time I purchase it.

Love this Serum,5,"I've been using this product on and off for a few years. When I didn't use the serum consistently, smoother skin and evened tone were the noticeable results. But, since I started using the serum religiously twice a day for about eight months, the serum has minimized my fine lines, specifically the lines on my forehead and my frow burrow lines. Full disclosure - I use other SkinMedica products in addition to the serum, so the results may be from the combination of products and not the serum alone. Also, advice from a middle-aged woman who has been using skincare products for over 20 years. Always manage your expectations when using anti-aging skincare products. The results are noticeable but not drastic.",10/11/21,Michele,False,4,0
just magic,5,"This product is just magic. I can't explain it. After only a few uses, my skin is so smooth and plump. It's like filler and botox in a bottle. I wish they were a little more transparent about what's in it and what it actually does but it's just great and unfortunately I'm addicted to this expensive serum. The biggest complaint I have is that I hate the packaging. You can't tell when you're running low to repurchase. I would also love if this brand offered a travel sized/small bottle.

It works! If you can make it last ...,4,"The dispensing mechanism on this product is wasteful and awkward and should be changed. I ended up smashing the container open in the end and scooping up what was left with a Q-tip. Considering how much it costs, I didn't want to waste a drop. That said, it works. After a month of twice-daily usage, my skin is visibly improved, firmer and softer and smoother. So I ordered more and got on the subscription plan, which is worth it for a product this pricey. I just don't think there's anything else on the market quite like it. But I will be careful to use as little as possible this month.",10/6/21,Judy M.,True,4,0

Spectacular Results! Just be patient!,5,"This product is absolutely amazing. The price can be discouraging but you have to remember that this product is developed and created by actual scientists, who have their own data that they've collected and provide for you to see yourself. The ingredients are top of the line, patented, and extremely expensive to produce (especially Growth Factors). That being said- here are my thoughts on the ""SkinMedica TNS Advanced+ Serum"": You just have to be consistent, and patient. I didn't really notice the results until I was about a month in. One day I was doing my skin care regime and really looking at my skin and I had to take a step back and gasped. I couldn't believe how fresh, plump, even, clear, youthful, toned, smooth, and overall healthy my skin looked! I kept trying to think what I did differently that would make such a tremendous difference, and then I remembered it had been a little over 4 weeks since I started the TNS Advanced serum. That's the only logical explanation I can think of. It really does work wonders, you just have to give it time to do its job. What drove me nuts was that the day this happened was also the day I ran out! Needless to say I immediately ordered another one with express shipping, haha. This product is very easy to use. It's sanitary due to the inovative double pump. One pump is all you need per use. It's very light weight and absorbs into the skin immediately. It doesn't have a sticky or greasy feel once its absorbed. The smell is almost non existent. It's just a faint smell,  which is just a  result of the ingredients. If you dispense 1 pump, twice a day, this should last a month or so. I highly recommend getting the auto-monthly ship option so that you don't do what I did and run out just when it's starting to show it's working! Plus you save $$ on each bottle. This is definitely a staple in my skin care regime. You know it's working when other people are commenting and complimenting you. My boyfriend told me I looked younger the other day. He didn't understand why and doesn't know anything about the serum. He just looked at me and said ""you look younger, did you do something with your hair?"". Yeah, I think I'll stick with SkinMedica.

Amazing product,4,This is the best serum I have ever used. I purchased it during a sale to help absorb the cost. But after using it for a few weeks I realize it is well worth every penny.  I have tried a lot of serums out there. My skin is smoother and more bouncy and I can tell my skin absorbs it well. My only concern is the pump. At first only one side pumped out product. Them after several uses I realized that the other also contained product and it seems to be working fine now. But this company needs to get it together as far as that goes. Why waste such a good thing? I will purchase it again but only if the pump keeps working as it should. ,9/27/21,CMarie,True,3,0

Fountain of Youth,5,"I take VERY good care of my skin and this serum is my one MUST have in my arsenal. Over time, my skin has become less sensitive, more vibrant and time has stood still.

After applying my retinol, I apply this magic serum and my skin elasticity has remained healthy and only improved over my years of consistent use. (I used the original formula and switched to this new one as soon as it was released). I also love that the ingredients are dispersed from separate openings to mix immediately at the time of use to harness all of the potential benefits of the ingredients.

Seems to keep skin more hydrated,4,I was not sure if I was seeing any results until I ran out.

Too Pricy to not work,3,I used the entire tub and saw absolutely no results. My skin did not get tighter. My fine lines still remain. And the packaging is awful! It broke halfway through using it and was only working out of one side (it's a 2 sided pump). It does not evenly disperse the product.

Too soon to tell,4,I have been using this serum for 3 weeks and don't see a significant difference in my skin yet. I am hoping with continued use I will see some results.

Still on the Fence,1,"I am 70yo and have extremely good skin according to both dermatologists and aestheticians. I originally purchased TNS Essential Serum to address some deep lines across the bridge of my nose and upper lip (no, I never smoked) before I realized there was a TNS Advanced Serum for deep and coarse lines. In finished the TNS Essential Serum purchase (without noticing any results) and immediately started the TNS Advanced, which I have been using for 2 weeks now. (Note: the serums, used 1x per day will last one month and 8 days) So far, I have noticed nothing. Is this because I'm only using 1x per day? Perhaps. But the price is exorbitant and I wanted to stretch my purchases out. So, for now, I'm on the fence. I do want to give this the benefit of the doubt and have another bottle of TNS Advanced on hand. So, if after the 3rd bottle I notice nothing, I will write another review saying so. Glad this works for others. Perhaps they are not as old as me or their creases aren't as deep.",2/15/21,Anonymous,True,6,0
It Really Does Work,4,"I used this product years ago and stopped for two reasons - it was hard to justify the cost and the pumping mechanism distributed product unevenly, depleting one side before the other.

Still Evaluating Value vs Cost,4,"So far my skin has looked great with this product - but it's also pandemic, I'm wearing little make-up, doing a lot more involved skincare, so it's hard to say what to attribute it to. I do believe tone and texture have improved, and I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the cost is so high that it really needs to blow my socks off and hasn't done that quite yet.

New packaging same results,5,"This is a great product now that it is missing the smell of the old version. The downside to this is the increase in price since it is ""new"". Overall it is a great product but you might want to skip this if you are younger.",8/23/20,Anonymous,False,1,0
Fantastic Product but Horrible Dispenser Pump,3,"For the price of this product, you'd think that the marketing people at skin medica would notice how the pump mechanism is the worst. On top of that, the packaging must cost a fortune which I'm sure adds to the outrages cost of the product. On the other had, it's a heck of a product.....I've used it for at least a year but I'm done until they improve the pump even more.......! Why the heck do you have to make such fancy packaging anyway.....you could bring the cost down a bit and still have a wonderful product.",8/23/20,Jennifer,True,2,0

Excellent Product,5,This product has definitely improved the texture of my skin. My fine lines around my eyes are less notable and my skin has a smoother texture. Will be purchasing this again!,8/18/20,Anonymous,True,0,0
Nice Upgrade!,5,This formula is a nice upgrade from the previous version. Does not go on as sticky as last version. Will continue to use.,8/14/20,Anonymous,False,0,0
Like the serum; not the packaging,4,"Although I have been cutting costs on my skincare, I bought this because of an article I read about it. And I have to say: yes, I think it does something none of my less expensive skincare has done. It's not irritating, drying or greasy; did seem to clear up a blocked pore I've had for a year; feels good on my skin. But as another reviewer said, the formula comes out unevenly. I just started a second container (be aware that used twice a day, one bottle only lasts a month) and after three days, none of the white cream is coming out, only the clear gel. And since the bottle is completely sealed, I can't even go in and try to correct for this. Despite the price, I might have continued with it but this is a deal breaker.",8/11/20,Jo,True,10,6
Not as good as the previous TNS,3,"Was using the previous TNS serum with the retinol and HA5 system. Ran out and decided to try this new formula. First, the two liquids did not come out evenly. Maybe a faulty pump. The clear serum often comes out more than the white. Second, it leaves a white residue on the skin after rubbing in. At first I thought it was because I was applying the HA5 moisturizer too soon after the serum. So I waited for a few minutes for it to absorb. Still have same problem. Have not noticed any difference between this and the previous formula (have been using about a month). So will not buy again.",8/9/20,Danielle,True,2,0
"expensive, but so worth it!",5,"smell is pleasant, product dispenses easily. one pump is enough to cover my face generously and have leftover product for neck and back of hands. i've only been using once daily in AM. i think the first 1 or 2 days, my face was slightly irritated, and i thought it might be due to using it at night along with my retin-A. so i adjusted by applying in the AM only. the only other products i use along with it are skinceuticals CE ferrulic and elta MD UV clear. anyway, i saw results very quickly- 1-2 weeks! my face looks clear, bright, and smooth and it feels firmer. out of all the skincare products, peels and procedures (microneedling) i've tried, this has made the biggest difference! it is quite expensive, but i do think it's worth it and will continue using it. i'm interested to see how long one bottle will last with only using once daily.",8/8/20,Anonymous,True,8,2
Pump not working,1,"Received my advanced+ serum today and i was so excited to use tonight. After multiple pumps only the clear serum half is dispensing, I am getting zero white serum. And for $300 for one ounce, I have wasted at least two weeks worth of product to attempt to dispense the both of the active serums together, as they are directed and designed to be used so. Extremely disappointed.",7/31/20,Jennifer,True,2,0
Trusted Line and Brand,5,I first saw this at a local med spa. The brand is trusted and clinical results.,7/24/20,Anonymous,False,1,0
Results not worth the cost,2,"I bought this 5 weeks ago and the bottle ran out today. 70 pumps is all that there is in there. I had asked SkinMedica how many pumps were in each bottle when I purchased it, and was told 84. For the price point on this product, I don't really see any remarkable results from using it twice a day for 5 weeks. There are so many products out there to choose from that do deliver results in that amount of time, so, unfortunately, this will not be one I recommend. I loved the old Recovery Complex and felt that I got more from that than this new formulation.",7/24/20,Anonymous,False,1,0
Good Upgrade,4,"I've been using TNS serum for years now and decided to give this new version a try about 1 month ago. Positives- smooth consistency, absorbs quickly, tightens and reduces lines, no smell and one pump covers my face, neck and chest. Negatives- I find this to be drying and need to add a moisturizer over it. In general I'm oily in my t-zone and now I'm dry and a peeling a bit. I purchased it hoping to help improve hyperpigmentation but I've not seen any improvement.",7/14/20,Anonymous,True,10,7
"So Far, So Good",5,"I've been using this product for one week, and so far my skin is handling it well. I use it after a refreshing toner, but before my moisturizer. Texture is smooth, and the serum absorbs easily. Looking forward to seeing results.",7/14/20,Anonymous,True,0,0
My favorite product,5,"Helps to smooth skin, reduce wrinkles and hydrate skin. Don't even need extra eye creams. This does it all!",7/13/20,Lynn,True,1,0
Like it so far!,5,"Very nice packaging and bottle. I haven't been using long enough to see results, but I like the consistency. It feels soothing after application, and it dries fast and doesn't make my face oily. Easy to wear under makeup. So far so good!",7/10/20,Amie,True,0,0
Wonderful,5,Better than the TNS recovery and Essential. Better for acne prone skin. This product literally made a scar disappear. I use it around the eyes too. Worth every dime.,7/8/20,Anonymous,True,1,0

Better than previous version by far,5,I have used the last version and although the results were pretty good I only used in the morning because of the disgusting smell. Also I had a bit of irritation adjusting to it. I liked it before but I didn't love the drawbacks. With the new version the horrid smell is gone and I can now tolerate using twice daily. My skin is looking super smooth and lines are diminished after two weeks. Can't wait for further results. I'm sure this will become a staple in my routine.,6/29/20,Anonymous,False,7,4
My NEW Favorite product!,5,WOW! I have been using it for 1 week and I can already see a difference in my skin. My skin looks firmer and tighter. Have had 2 people already tell me how great my skin looks. I can especially notice the difference in my cheeks and eye area. I was on the fence about purchasing it because of the price but IT IS WORTH IT! Will buy again when I run out.,6/29/20,Vanessa,True,1,0
